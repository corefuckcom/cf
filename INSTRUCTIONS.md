# 📋 MASTER TASK LIST & LINKS

Here is your checklist to go live with **Corefuck.com**.

## 🚀 1. Acquisition (Links)
You need "Adult Friendly" services. **Do not use standard hosts** (like Bluehost/GoDaddy) as they may ban you.

- [ ] **Buy Domain / Check DNS**: You own `corefuck.com`.
  - *Keep using this.* No need for `.ai`.
- [ ] **Get Hosting** (Choose one):
  - [ ] **Porkbun** (Recommended): [https://porkbun.com](https://porkbun.com)
    - *Why:* Cheap, privacy-first, very adult-friendly.
  - [ ] **Namecheap**: [https://namecheap.com](https://namecheap.com)
    - *Why:* Reliable, accepts 18+ content.
  - [ ] **OrangeWebsite**: [https://www.orangewebsite.com](https://www.orangewebsite.com)
    - *Why:* Offshore (Iceland), maximum freedom of speech/content.

## 🛠️ 2. Website Setup (Your Job)
The code is ready. Now you need to put your "stuff" in it.

- [ ] **Generate/Download Images**:
  - You need 5 placeholder images for the girls.
  - Name them: `elodie.jpg`, `mila.jpg`, `isabella.jpg`, `olivia.jpg`, `luna.jpg`.
  - Put them in the project folder.
- [ ] **Update Image Code**:
  - In `index.html`, replace `<div class="p1">...</div>` with `<img src="elodie.jpg">`.
- [ ] **Add Your Money Links**:
  - Open `script.js`.
  - Replace the "test" links with your **CrackRevenue Smartlinks**.

## 🚀 3. Deployment (Go Live)
- [ ] **Upload Files**:
  - Upload `index.html`, `style.css`, `script.js`, `terms.html`, `privacy.html`, and your images to the `public_html` folder of your host.
